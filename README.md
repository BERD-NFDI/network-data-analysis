# Repository for BERD Academy Tutorial "A Connected World: Data Analysis for Real-World Network Data"

In the sub-folders of this repository, we provide slides and replication code for the data analysis carried out in this tutorial. 
The exercises (and solutions) for the hands-on session are also given in the respective folders.

For solving the exercises, you should already have R (version 4.0 or later) and RStudio installed on your machine. You can download both of them for free from CRAN (https://cran.r-project.org/). In addition to that, it would be best if you also have the following R packages installed:

dplyr, abind, network, igraph, ergm, blockmodels, amen, latentnet.

You should easily be able to install those packages by using the *install.packages(“PACKAGENAME”)* syntax directly in the R console.
